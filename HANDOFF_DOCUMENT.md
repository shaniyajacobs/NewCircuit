## 📚 Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices and patterns
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes for styling
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Use consistent naming conventions

### File Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.js`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.js`)
- CSS modules: ComponentName.module.css
- Pages: PascalCase (e.g., `Dashboard.js`)
- Contexts: PascalCase (e.g., `ProfileContext.js`)

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Local state with useState for component-specific data
- Firebase real-time listeners for data synchronization
- Avoid prop drilling by using context appropriately

### Error Handling
- Implement try-catch blocks for async operations
- Use error boundaries for component-level error handling
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging purposes

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Auth handles user authentication
- Protected routes with PrivateRoute component
- Role-based access control for admin/business features
- JWT token validation
- Session management

### Data Security
- Firestore security rules control data access
- User data isolation and privacy
- Admin-only access to sensitive operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration

### API Security
- Rate limiting on Firebase Functions
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Secure environment variable handling
- HTTPS enforcement
